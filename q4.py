Topological sort (what I'm assuming you mean by tropical sort)
Is an algorithm meant for placing nodes in a directed acyclical graph
in an order such that each node only points to nodes after itself in
the list. Since the input to the function is a one dimentional array,
there is no clear way to understand the input as a graph, and thus the question
is invalid.

This implementation assumes that the array represents a graph where each node 
points to the next node in the array, in order. Here's my implementation:
